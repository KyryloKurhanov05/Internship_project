Inspection Dashboard — Frontend Project
This project is a learning-oriented frontend application that simulates a simple inspection tool used in industrial quality control. It is inspired by workflows similar to those in Exact x Forestall — a company specializing in inspection, sorting, and verification of automotive components.
The goal of the project is to demonstrate the step-by-step growth of my frontend development skills.
The project is organized into three stages, each stored in a separate Git branch.

- Branches
1. version1 — Basic Functionality
The first version contains the essential features of the project, including:
- displaying inspected batches (OK / FAIL)
- category filters
- simple batch cards
- summary counters
- basic project structure
This version serves as the foundation for all upcoming improvements.

2. version2 — Extended Features
In the second version, the project becomes more practical and interactive:
- live search by batch number
- adding new batches through a form
- deleting items with confirmation
- full LocalStorage integration
- a separate “Batch Details” page
- improved styling and layout
This stage reflects progress in DOM manipulation, form handling, and client-side data management.

3. version3 — Advanced System
The third version introduces more serious, production-like features:
- login page
- user roles (supervisor / operator)
- role-based permissions and restricted actions
- activity logs with filtering
- CSV export for batches and logs
- redesigned UI with better structure and animations
- responsive layout for mobile/tablet use
- edit mode for batch details (supervisor only)
This version resembles a small internal system used in real inspection environments.

 - About the Project

The dashboard simulates the workflow of quality inspection, allowing users to:
- view inspected batches
- filter, search, add, delete, and edit records
- open detailed batch pages
- track user actions in a log system
- export inspection data
- work with different access levels (operator / supervisor)

The project was created for learning purposes to demonstrate growth in:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- state handling with LocalStorage
- interface design and UX improvements
- responsive web design
- multi-page project structuring
- building basic authentication and role logic
